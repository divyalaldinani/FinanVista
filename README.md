## Introduction

This application is designed to provide users with a comprehensive financial overview, enriched by machine learning predictions to forecast market trends and other financial insights. The project leverages the power of the MERN stack to create a scalable and maintainable solution:

- **Frontend:**  
  - **Vite:** A fast and lean starter application for React projects, offering instant hot-module replacement and speedy builds.
  - **Redux Toolkit:** Simplifies state management across your app, making it easier to manage and debug state changes.
  - **Material UI:** Provides a robust, accessible, and customizable component library that streamlines the development of a responsive user interface.
  - **Recharts:** Delivers beautiful and customizable charts to visualize financial data and predictions.

- **Backend:**  
  - **Node.js:** Serves as the runtime environment to run JavaScript on the server side.
  - **Express.js:** Acts as the backend framework to build RESTful APIs quickly and efficiently.
  - **MongoDB:** A flexible, NoSQL database that stores financial data and machine learning outputs in a scalable format.

By combining these technologies, the app not only displays real-time financial metrics but also harnesses the power of machine learning to predict future trends, offering actionable insights to its users.
